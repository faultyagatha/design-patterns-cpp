# Command

- a command is a reified method call: a method call wrapped in an object
- commands are an object-oriented replacement for callbacks.
 
 > Reflection systems in some languages let you work with the types in your program imperatively at runtime. You can get an object that represents the class of some other object, and you can play with that to see what the type can do. In other words, reflection is a reified type system.


- when you have an interface with a single method that doesn’t return anything, there’s a good chance it’s the Command pattern.
